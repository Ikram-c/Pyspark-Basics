## Overview of project

The notebook goes over an introduction to pyspark and covers PysparkSQL, Data wrangling and Pyspark ML. 
The data used for the notebook was the california housing prices dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices). 
Data preprocessing is also used to ensure that the ML models had some level of optimisation, the ML model used was Elastic net.
